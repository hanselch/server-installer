This is a one-stop place to get server mods and assets.

There are two functions being used for grabbing any assets:
- Mods
    - Update
    - Install
    - &; remove mods (used for debugging)
- Shaders
    - You can get shaders and install them through the app.
- Map
    - You can also install the map immedietly by one click.
